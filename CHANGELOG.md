# Changelog

All notable changes to the Honeydew AI Plugins for Coding Agents are documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Codex plugin support** — add `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, and Codex installation documentation

- **Agent-neutral documentation** — update README examples and stale skill cross-references to use current skill names

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Update search_model documentation across all skills** — document required `search_mode` parameter (`OR`/`AND`/`EXACT`), `entity.field` scoping syntax, and guidance on which mode to use for lookups vs. broad discovery

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **First stable release** — bumped to 1.0.0

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Update query skill** — `ask_deep_analysis_question` now accepts `agent` (optional) instead of `domain`; use `list_agents` to discover available agents
- **Update model-exploration skill** — added Agents & Context discovery tools: `list_agents`, `get_agent`, `list_context_items`, `get_context_item`
- **Update domain-creation skill** — noted that a domain must be exposed through an agent for AI analysis

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Combine into single plugin** — merged `data-analysis-tools` and `semantic-modeling-tools` into a single `honeydew-ai` plugin. All 9 skills are now available from one plugin installation.
- **Add Honeydew MCP server** — `https://api.honeydew.cloud/mcp/` is now bundled in all `.mcp.json` configurations alongside the existing Honeydew documentation MCP.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- **Remove ask-question tools** — removed `ask_question_get_data` and `ask_question_get_sql` from the query skill, model-exploration skill, and hook matcher
- **Expand deep analysis scope** — `ask_deep_analysis_question` now covers simple natural language questions in addition to complex/multi-step analysis, replacing the removed ask-question tools

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Gemini CLI support** — skills directory moved from `skills/` to `.gemini/skills/` for native Gemini CLI integration

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Workspace & branch session tools** — document `list_workspaces`, `list_workspace_branches`, `get_session_workspace_and_branch`, `set_session_workspace_and_branch`, and `create_workspace_branch` MCP tools in model-exploration skill
- **Prerequisites sections** — all creation skills and the query skill now include workspace/branch context prerequisites

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Domain discovery tools** — document `list_domains` and `get_domain` MCP tools in model-exploration, domain-creation, and query skills

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-08

- **order_by quoted strings** — all `order_by` field references now use double-quoted strings (SQL identifier style) across query, filtering, and model-exploration skills

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Duplicate values example** in the query skill — find duplicates by fetching a field with its count and filtering on count > 1
- **Order by count** in the distinct values tip for better data exploration
- **Metric value filtering** section in the filtering skill — filtering on aggregated values (post-aggregation), with examples in `examples.md`

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- `.cursor/skills/` directory with symlinks to all plugin skills

- **PreToolUse hooks** for both plugins — automatically prompt skill loading when Honeydew MCP tools are called

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Distinct values tip** in the query skill — how to retrieve unique values for a field by combining it as an attribute with a COUNT metric

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- Updated MCP tool names and added warehouse discovery tools

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
