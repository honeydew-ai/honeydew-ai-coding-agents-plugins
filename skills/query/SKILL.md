name: query
description: Use when the user wants to query, analyze, or explore data through the Honeydew semantic layer. Covers structured queries and multi-step deep analysis.
---

## Prerequisites

Queries run against the workspace and branch set for the current session. Use `get_session_workspace_and_branch` to check the current context. If no workspace/branch is set, use `list_workspaces`, `list_workspace_branches`, and `set_session_workspace_and_branch` to select one. See the `workspace-branch` skill for the full workspace/branch tool reference.

## Overview

Honeydew provides three ways to query data through the semantic layer. Each method suits a different situation — pick the right one based on how well you understand the model and how complex the question is.

| Method                    | Tool                                              | Best For                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured query**      | `get_data_from_fields` / `get_sql_from_fields`    | You know the exact fields. Deterministic, full control.                          |
| **Deep analysis**         | `initiate_analysis` + `monitor_analysis`          | Any natural language question — simple or complex, "why", multi-step, agentic.  |
| **Explain a prior step**  | `get_analysis_step_details`                       | User asks how a specific step in a prior analysis was calculated.                |

## When to Use Each Method

### 1. Structured Query (`get_data_from_fields` / `get_sql_from_fields`)

**Use when:**

- You know the entity, attribute, and metric names (or can discover them via `list_entities` / `get_entity`)
- You need precise control over filters, ordering, and field selection
- You want deterministic, reproducible results
- You need to validate a newly created metric or attribute
- The user specifies exact fields like "show me `detailed_listings.price` by `detailed_listings.room_type`"

**Do NOT use when:**

- The question requires multi-step reasoning or investigation

**How it works:**

- `get_data_from_fields` — executes the query and returns data rows
- `get_sql_from_fields` — returns the generated SQL without executing (useful for review, debugging, or handing off to other tools)

Both take the same field parameters.

### 2. Deep Analysis (`initiate_analysis` + `monitor_analysis`)

**Use when:**

- The user asks a question in plain English and you don't know the exact field names
- The user wants a quick answer without worrying about model details
- The question requires multiple steps or investigative reasoning
- The user asks "why" something happened (e.g., "why did revenue drop in Q3?")
- The user wants trend analysis, anomaly detection, or root cause investigation
- The question is open-ended and may require looking at the data from multiple angles
- Follow-up questions build on prior analysis (use `conversation_id`)

---

## Decision Flow

```
User asks a data question
    │
    ├─► User asks to explain / drill into a step from a prior analysis?
    │       └─► get_analysis_step_details (step_id from monitor_analysis)
    │           Returns semantic query, data results, and SQL for that step
    │
    ├─► Do you know the exact field names?
    │       │
    │       ├─► YES → get_data_from_fields (structured, deterministic)
    │       │         (or get_sql_from_fields to preview SQL without executing)
    │       │
    │       └─► NO → initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis (plain English, any complexity)
    │
    └─► Plain English question / investigation / "why" / trends?
            └─► initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis
```

## Method 1: Structured Query

### Field Parameters

A structured query uses flat field parameters to define what data to retrieve:

- **`attributes`** — dimensions to group by (columns in the output), e.g. `["entity.attribute_name"]`
- **`metrics`** — aggregated measures (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.), e.g. `["entity.metric_name"]`
- **`filters`** — row-level filters applied before aggregation, e.g. `["entity.field = 'value'"]`
- **`order_by`** — sort order for results. **Each entry MUST be a quoted string**, as if it were a SQL identifier — e.g. `["\"entity.field\" ASC"]`. Always wrap the field reference in double quotes inside the string.
- **`domain`** — optional domain name for query context
- **`limit`** — max rows to return (default: 100)
- **`offset`** — rows to skip (for pagination)

All fields use `entity.field_name` syntax. Cross-entity fields are supported when relations exist.

### Discovering Fields

Before building a query, discover the available fields:

1. `list_entities` — see all entities
2. `get_entity` with entity name — see its attributes, metrics, and relations
3. `get_field` with entity and field name — get detailed info about a specific field
4. `list_domains` — see all available domains (useful before passing `domain` parameter)
5. `search_model` with a keyword and `search_mode` (`OR` for broad discovery, `EXACT` for known names) — find fields across the model

### Examples

**Simple metric query — total count:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`

**Dimension breakdown — listings by room type:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Filtered query — only entire homes:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.neighbourhood_cleansed"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `filters`: `["detailed_listings.room_type = 'Entire home/apt'"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Cross-entity query — listings with host info:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type", "dim_host.host_is_superhost"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"detailed_listings.count\" DESC"]`

**Using aliases — rename fields or ad-hoc expressions:**

You can alias any field or ad-hoc expression using `AS "alias_name"`. This controls the column name in the output.

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["detailed_listings.count AS \"total_listings\"", "AVG(detailed_listings.price) AS \"avg_price\""]`
- `order_by`: `["\"total_listings\" DESC"]`

Once aliased, use the alias (not the original expression) in `order_by`.

**Pagination — large result sets:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: (your fields)
- `metrics`: (your metrics)
- `limit`: 50 (max rows to return)
- `offset`: 100 (skip first 100 rows)

**Finding duplicate values:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.host_name"]`
- `metrics`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name)"]`
- `filters`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name) > 1"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"COUNT(detailed_listings.host_name)\" DESC"]`

This groups by the attribute, counts occurrences, and filters to only rows that appear more than once — surfacing duplicates.

**SQL preview only:**

Call `get_sql_from_fields` with the same field parameters to see the generated SQL without executing.

### Filter Syntax

Filters use standard comparison expressions: `=`, `>`, `<`, `IN (...)`, `ILIKE`, `SEARCH(...)`, `IS NULL`, booleans, date ranges, and `AND`/`OR` combinations.

> For the complete filter expression reference — including SEARCH, date handling, and type casting — see the **filtering** skill.

## Method 2: Deep Analysis

### initiate_analysis + monitor_analysis

Deep analysis is a two-step async process:

**Step 1 — start the analysis:**

Call `initiate_analysis` with:

- `question` (required): the analysis question
- `agent` (required for new conversations): agent name — use `list_agents` to discover available agents and their associated domains
- `conversation_id` (optional): ID from a previous call, for follow-up questions

Returns a `conversation_id` immediately. New conversations also return a `ui_url` — **always display this URL to the user** so they can follow the analysis in the Honeydew application.

**Step 2 — poll until done:**

Call `monitor_analysis` repeatedly with the `conversation_id` until `status` is `"DONE"`. Each call returns only new messages since the last call.

**`stop_reason` values — what they mean:**

| `stop_reason` | Meaning | What to do |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| `null` | Still running | Keep polling |
| `"DONE"` | Finished normally | Read `responses` array for the final report |
| `"ASK"` | Analysis paused to ask a clarifying question | Read `responses` for the question, answer with a new `initiate_analysis` on the same `conversation_id` |
| `"ABORTED"` | This execution run was stopped | **Not terminal.** Conversation state is preserved — continue with a new `initiate_analysis` on the same `conversation_id` |

**Report progress when it's meaningful to the user** — not every poll, but not silently either. Use judgement:

- On `interpretation` / `plan`: tell the user what the analysis intends to do
- On `step_insight` with a substantive finding: post a one-liner labelled with the step description (if available) or "Step #N" (1-based) — e.g. *"Step #1: 58 menu items found, top is The King Combo at $431M"*
- On internal errors, retries, or backtracking steps: skip reporting — the user doesn't need to know the agent corrected itself, only that meaningful progress is being made

When `status` is `"DONE"`, the final user-facing report is in the `responses` array.

```
# Example
initiate_analysis(question="Analyze revenue by cuisine type", agent="my_agent")
→ { conversation_id: "abc123", ui_url: "https://..." }

# Poll loop — report to user after each call that has new content
monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ interpretation + plan received → tell user what the analysis will do

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ step insight received → report: "Step #1: Top item is Indian at $1B"

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ step insight received → report: "% contribution: Indian leads at 34%, followed by Italian at 22%"

...

monitor_analysis(conversation_id="abc123")
→ { status: "DONE", responses: [{ text: "..." }] }
```

### Follow-up Questions

Use `conversation_id` from the previous analysis to ask follow-up questions that build on prior state. **Start a new conversation (omit `conversation_id`) when the topic changes completely** — reusing a conversation for an unrelated question carries stale context into the new analysis and can skew results.

```
initiate_analysis(
  question="Now break this down by room type — does the pattern hold?",
  conversation_id="abc123"
)
```

### Aborting and Resuming an Analysis

Aborting stops the current execution run but preserves all conversation state — groups already computed remain available. Resume by sending a new `initiate_analysis` with the same `conversation_id`; the analysis will reuse prior results rather than restarting from scratch.

Always abort when the user asks. Initiating an abort on your own (without the user asking) is reserved for extreme cases where the analysis is clearly going badly off track — normally let it finish and redirect via a follow-up question.

### Explaining a Prior Analysis Step

When the user asks to explain, review, or drill into a specific step (e.g., "how was that calculated?", "explain the cuisine breakdown", "what happened in step 5"):

1. Identify the `step_id` from `monitor_analysis` progress messages (e.g. `"STEP/5"`)
2. Call `get_analysis_step_details` with `conversation_id` and `step_id`

Returns:
- The semantic query used (attributes, metrics, filters)
- Context resolved (which entities/fields Honeydew selected)
- Context items used (if any instructions or knowledge were applied)
- Data results from that step
- The SQL generated for that step

References in the response can be expanded for deeper inspection:
- Field references (e.g. `entity.field_name`) → `get_field` — shows the full definition, useful if the user wants to understand how a metric or attribute is calculated
- Context item references → `get_context_item` — shows the instruction or knowledge applied during that step

### Example Questions

**Simple natural language:**
- "What are the top 10 neighbourhoods by number of listings?"
- "Show me average price by room type."

**Complex analysis:**
- "Why did the average review score drop for listings in Brooklyn?"
- "What factors most influence listing price? Analyze the key drivers."
- "Compare superhost vs non-superhost performance across all metrics."
- "Identify unusual patterns in listing availability over the past year."
- "What are the characteristics of top-performing listings?"

**Step explanation (use `get_analysis_step_details`, not a new question):**
- "How was that calculated?"
- "Explain the cuisine breakdown."
- "Show me what happened in that step."
- "What fields were used there?"

---

## Combining Methods

For complex tasks, combine methods in sequence:

1. **Discover** — Use `list_entities` / `get_entity` to understand the model
2. **Query** — Use `get_data_from_fields` for precise, targeted queries
3. **Investigate** — Use `initiate_analysis` + `monitor_analysis` for root cause or trend analysis

### Example Workflow

User: "Help me understand pricing patterns for Airbnb listings."

1. Discover entities: `list_entities` → find `detailed_listings`
2. Explore fields: `get_entity` for `detailed_listings` → find `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`
3. Targeted query: `get_data_from_fields` → price distribution by neighbourhood for Entire homes only
4. Deep dive: `initiate_analysis` → "What factors most influence listing price? Analyze correlations with room type, location, amenities, and reviews."

---

## Documentation Lookup

Use the `honeydew-docs` MCP tools to search the Honeydew documentation when:

- The user asks about query capabilities or features not covered in this skill
- You need to understand how the query API interacts with domains, parameters, or governance rules
- The user encounters unexpected query behavior and needs deeper context on how the semantic layer resolves queries

Search for topics like: "queries", "perspectives", "dynamic datasets", "parameters", "query API".

## Tip: Getting Distinct Values for a Field

To retrieve the distinct (unique) values of a field, include it in `attributes` and add a count metric in `metrics`.
Use the entity's built-in count metric (e.g., `entity.count`) if available, or an ad-hoc count metric using `COUNT(entity.field)`
on the field whose distinct values you want — never use `COUNT(*)`.
The metric forces aggregation, which groups by the attribute and returns one row per distinct value.

**Example — distinct room types:**

Call `get_data_from_fields` with:

- `attributes`: `["detailed_listings.room_type"]`
- `metrics`: `["COUNT(detailed_listings.room_type)"]`
- `order_by`: `["\"COUNT(detailed_listings.room_type)\" DESC"]`

This returns each unique `room_type` along with its count, ordered by frequency. The count is a useful bonus — it tells you how common each value is — but the key point is that the query returns **one row per distinct value**.

This pattern is useful for:

- **Exploring filter values** — find out what values exist before writing a filter expression (see the **filtering** skill)
- **Validating a new attribute** — after creating a calculated attribute, check its distinct output values to confirm the logic is correct (see the **attribute-creation** skill)
- **Understanding data distribution** — see how data is spread across categories

---

## Best Practices

- **Start with discovery** — always check `list_entities` / `get_entity` before building queries, so you reference real fields
- **Use structured queries for precision** — when you know the fields, `get_data_from_fields` gives you full control and reproducible results
- **Use deep analysis for insight** — when the question is about "why" or requires investigating multiple dimensions
- **Report meaningful progress, not every step** — surface a one-liner when a step produces a substantive finding; skip internal retries and error-recovery steps the user doesn't need to see
- **Explain a prior step** — use `get_analysis_step_details` with the `step_id`; the response includes the semantic query, data results, and SQL for that step
- **Paginate large results** — use `limit` and `offset` in `get_data_from_fields` to avoid overwhelming output
- **Show SQL when debugging** — use `get_sql_from_fields` to inspect the generated query
- **Reference fields correctly** — always use `entity.field_name` syntax in field parameters
