description: Use when exploring Honeydew semantic layer, discovering entities/fields, or querying data. For creating metrics use metric-creation skill. For creating attributes use attribute-creation skill.

# Instructions

## When To Use This Skill

Before ANY Honeydew work, discover the model:

**Step 1: List entities**
Use the `list_entities` MCP tool to see all entities in the model.

**Step 2: Explore entity details**
Use the `get_entity` MCP tool with the relevant entity name to list its attributes, metrics, datasets, and relations.

**Step 3: Search the model**
Use the `search_model` MCP tool to find specific fields, entities, or other objects by name.

## Overview

Honeydew is the Semantic Layer for AI and BI. Honeydew enables a shared source of truth for data teams, providing consistency, flexibility, governance and performance.
It provides metrics and attributes over data warehouse tables and views (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery) that have relationships defined between them.
Use the Honeydew MCP tools to interact with the model.

## MCP Tools

### Discovery

- `list_entities` - List all entities in the model (names, keys, descriptions)
- `get_entity` - Get detailed info for a specific entity (attributes, metrics, datasets, relations, YAML)
- `get_field` - Get detailed info for a specific field (attribute or metric) within an entity
- `search_model` - Search across all model objects (entities, attributes, metrics, datasets, perspectives, domains, parameters)

### Warehouse Discovery

- `list_tables` - List tables in the connected data warehouse (optionally filter by database/schema)
- `get_table_info` - Get column-level details for a specific warehouse table

### Query Execution

- `preview_data_from_yaml` - Execute a YAML perspective query and return data (supports `limit` and `offset` for pagination)
- `get_sql_from_yaml` - Generate SQL from a YAML perspective query without executing

### AI-Powered Queries

- `ask_question_get_data` - Natural language question → executes query and returns results
- `ask_question_get_sql` - Natural language question → returns generated SQL only
- `ask_deep_analysis_question` - Multi-step agentic analysis for complex/why questions

## Example Usage

### Query API Decision Flow

```
User Request
    │
    ├─► Exact field names known? Want structured query?
    │       └─► YES → preview_data_from_yaml (deterministic, YAML perspective)
    │
    ├─► Simple question in plain English?
    │       └─► YES → ask_question_get_data (natural language → results)
    │
    └─► Complex analysis / multi-step / "why" questions?
            └─► YES → ask_deep_analysis_question (agentic)
```

| Tool                         | Use When                    | Example Request                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `preview_data_from_yaml`     | Known fields, programmatic  | "Get total_revenue by month for 2021"         |
| `ask_question_get_data`      | Plain English, single query | "Show me revenue by city last 2 years"        |
| `ask_deep_analysis_question` | Trends, root cause, "why"   | "Find revenue drops and contributing factors" |

---

### preview_data_from_yaml (Primary - Known Fields)

Call `preview_data_from_yaml` with a YAML perspective definition:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: my_query
attributes:
  - order_header.order_year_month
metrics:
  - order_header.total_revenue
filters:
  - order_header.order_year_month LIKE '2021%'
order_by:
  - order_header.order_year_month ASC
```

Optional parameters:

- `limit` — max rows to return (default: 100)
- `offset` — rows to skip (for pagination)

---

### get_sql_from_yaml (SQL Preview)

Same YAML format as `preview_data_from_yaml`, but returns the generated SQL without executing it.

---

### ask_question_get_data (Natural Language → Results)

Call with:

- `question`: `"show me revenue broken down by month and city, for the last 2 years"`
- `max_rows`: `100` (required — maximum rows to return)

---

### ask_question_get_sql (Natural Language → SQL Only)

Call with:

- `question`: `"show me revenue broken down by month and city, for the last 2 years"`

Returns the generated SQL query without executing it.

---

### ask_deep_analysis_question (Complex Analysis)

Call with:

- `question`: `"Look at last 5 years, identify revenue drops and find contributing factors"`
- `conversation_id`: `"conv_123"` (optional, for follow-up questions)

**Returns:** markdown analysis report, data, suggested follow-up questions, conversation_id

---

### Discovery Examples

- Use `list_entities` to list all entities
- Use `get_entity` with an entity name to see its attributes, metrics, datasets, and relations
- Use `get_field` with entity name and field name to get detailed info about a specific field
- Use `search_model` with a query string to find any model object by name

## Documentation Lookup

Use the `honeydew-docs` MCP tools to search the Honeydew documentation when:

- The user asks conceptual questions ("what is an entity?", "how do metrics work?", "what is a semantic layer?")
- You need to explain Honeydew concepts, architecture, or terminology
- The user is new to Honeydew and needs orientation on capabilities
- You need to understand how a feature works beyond what the MCP tool descriptions provide
- The user asks about integrations, setup, or configuration

Search for topics like: "entities", "metrics", "attributes", "domains", "relations", "semantic layer", "governance", or any Honeydew-specific concept.

## Best Practices

1. Use `get_entity` to explore fields on a specific entity
2. Reference fields using `entity.field_name` syntax
3. Use discovery tools before any creation tasks
4. For creating entities, metrics, attributes, or relations - use the specialized skills listed above
