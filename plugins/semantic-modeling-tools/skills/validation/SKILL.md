name: validation
description: Use after creating or modifying ANY Honeydew object (metric, attribute, entity, relation). Provides type-specific validation logic to ensure objects work correctly and return sensible results.
---

## Overview

**This skill is MANDATORY after creating or modifying any Honeydew object.**

Validation ensures:

- The object compiles and executes without errors
- Results are returned (not NULL or empty)
- Values make business sense
- Related objects are consistent with each other

---

## Validation by Object Type

### Metrics

**Step 1: Execute the metric**

Call `preview_data_from_yaml` with:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_metric
metrics:
  - <entity>.<metric_name>
```

If the tool call fails (API error, permission denied, timeout), report the error to the user before proceeding. Do not confuse a tool error with suspicious data.

**Step 2: Sanity checks**

| Check           | What to Look For                      | Action if Failed                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Returns data    | Not NULL, not empty                   | Check SQL syntax, entity references                   |
| Magnitude       | Reasonable for business context       | Verify calculation logic                              |
| Sign            | Positive for revenue/counts (usually) | Check for inverted logic                              |
| Related metrics | Parts sum to whole                    | Query related metrics together and verify consistency |
| Ratios          | Between 0-100% (usually)              | Check numerator and denominator metrics independently |

**Step 3: Cross-validation**

If the new metric is a filtered subset of an existing metric, or a ratio of existing metrics, query them together to verify consistency:

- For filtered metrics: query the filtered metric alongside the unfiltered total — the filtered value should be less than or equal to the total.
- For ratio/derived metrics: query the numerator and denominator independently to confirm they return sensible values before checking the ratio.

Call `preview_data_from_yaml` with both metrics:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: cross_validate
metrics:
  - <entity>.<filtered_metric>
  - <entity>.<total_metric>
```

**Alert user if:**

- Metric returns $0 or NULL unexpectedly
- Revenue/count is negative
- Ratio exceeds 100% or is negative (unless expected)
- Magnitude seems off by orders of magnitude

---

### Attributes

**Step 1: Execute the attribute**

If the attribute references a related entity (multi-entity attribute), first verify the relation exists using `get_entity` on the source entity.
If the relation is missing, report that before attempting to query the attribute.

Sample rows — call `preview_data_from_yaml` with:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_attribute
attributes:
  - <entity>.<attribute_name>
```

For boolean attributes, check distribution — call `preview_data_from_yaml` with:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_boolean
attributes:
  - <entity>.<boolean_attribute>
metrics:
  - <entity>.count
```

**Step 2: Sanity checks by attribute type**

| Attribute Type      | Valid Range              | Red Flags                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Age/Duration**    | 0 to reasonable max      | Negative values, >150 years         |
| **Boolean**         | TRUE/FALSE mix           | All TRUE or all FALSE               |
| **Percentage**      | 0-100 (usually)          | Negative, >100 (unless growth rate) |
| **Date**            | Past to near future      | Year 1900, year 2099, all NULLs     |
| **Category/Bucket** | Expected labels          | 95%+ in "Unknown" or NULL           |
| **Rank**            | Starts at 1, consecutive | Starts at 0, gaps, all same value   |
| **Running total**   | Monotonically increasing | Decreases, resets unexpectedly      |
| **Any type**        | Mix of values            | >50% NULLs warrants investigation   |

**Alert user if:**

- All values are NULL or >50% NULLs
- Boolean is 100% one value
- Dates are invalid or in wrong century
- Buckets are mostly "Unknown"

---

### Entities

**Step 1: Verify entity was created**

Use `list_entities` and filter results for the new entity name.

**Step 2: Verify data flows**

Call `preview_data_from_yaml` with:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_entity
metrics:
  - <entity>.count
```

Also call with a list of attributes to verify they are accessible:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_entity_attributes
attributes:
  - <entity>.<attribute1>
  - <entity>.<attribute2>
  - <entity>.<attribute3>
  ...
```

**Step 3: Sanity checks**

| Check                 | What to Look For                 | Action if Failed             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Entity exists         | Shows in `list_entities` results | Check `create_entity` call   |
| Has rows              | Count > 0                        | Verify source table path     |
| Key is unique         | Count = count distinct of key    | Fix key or add composite key |
| Attributes accessible | Can query attributes             | Check dataset definition     |

**Alert user if:**

- Entity not found after creation
- Zero rows returned
- Key column has duplicates (for non-fact tables)

---

### Relations

**Step 1: Verify relation was created**

Use `get_entity` on the source entity and check its relations list for the new relation.

**Step 2: Test the join works**

Call `preview_data_from_yaml` with:

```yaml
type: perspective
name: validate_relation
attributes:
  - <target_entity>.<attribute>
metrics:
  - <source_entity>.<metric>
```

**Step 3: Sanity checks**

| Check            | What to Look For              | Action if Failed                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Relation exists  | Shows in `get_entity` results | Check `update_object` call                      |
| Join works       | Cross-entity query succeeds   | Verify join keys match                          |
| No fan-out       | Counts don't explode          | Check cardinality (many-to-one vs many-to-many) |
| NULLs reasonable | Some NULLs OK for left join   | Too many NULLs = bad join key                   |

**Alert user if:**

- Relation not created
- Cross-entity query fails
- Row count explodes (indicates wrong cardinality)
- All joined values are NULL (bad join condition)

## Validating Updates (update_object)

When modifying an existing object, compare before and after:

1. **Before altering**, query the object and note the current result.
2. **After altering**, query again and compare.
3. Report the difference to the user: "The metric `revenue` changed from `$1,234,567` to `$1,198,432` after applying the discount logic."

This confirms the change had the intended effect and helps catch unintended regressions.

## Error Handling

If a tool call fails, distinguish between:

| Situation                      | Meaning                                             | Action                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tool returns an error          | API error, permission denied, timeout, invalid YAML | Report the error message to the user. Do not treat as a validation failure — the object may not have been created. |
| Tool returns empty/NULL data   | Object was created but returns no results           | Proceed with sanity checks — likely a data or SQL issue.                                                           |
| Tool returns unexpected values | Object works but results look wrong                 | Report findings and ask user before attempting a fix.                                                              |

---

## Alerting Guidelines

When results seem wrong, report to the user with:

1. **The actual value** returned by the query
2. **Why it looks suspicious** (e.g., negative revenue, 100% NULL, row count doubled)
3. **A suggested next step** (e.g., "Should I check the SQL expression?" or "Should I verify the join keys?")

Do not silently fix issues — always surface findings and ask before making changes.

| Attribute | `preview_data_from_yaml` with attributes list | Range, distribution, NULLs          |
| Entity    | `list_entities` + `preview_data_from_yaml`    | Exists, has rows, key unique        |
| Relation  | `get_entity` + cross-entity perspective query | Exists, joins work, no fan-out      |
